# Questions asked by Prof Fanxin Kong after Proposal presentation on Sept 16th

* Q1: How do you define an object? how the kernel starts saving the objects to hard disk (read papers and confirm on this)
* Q2: What is the impact of network in the Object Storage system? Do you really see a value here?
* Q3: How scaling works and how this network change would impact the scaling?
* Q4: Design a metric collection mechanism first and commit on what we are trying to actually see.
