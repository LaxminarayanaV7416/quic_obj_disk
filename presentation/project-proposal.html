        <section>
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Data is the fuel cell for every organization these, so organiziing there data is one of the most demanding needs. with data demands organizations
          are looking for more scalable, reliable and cost effective storage solutions. There are mainly three types of storage systems available to store data. They are
          <ol>
            <li>File Storage</li>
            <li>Block Storage</li>
            <li>Object Storage</li>
          </ol>
          <p>let me summarize each of them quickly.</p>
          </p>

          <h2>Types of Storage Systems</h2>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>File Storage</h3>
          <p>File storage is the most common and traditional way of storing data. In file storage data is stored in a hierarchical structure with files and folders. It is easy to use and manage, but it has limitations in terms of scalability and performance.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
          <h3>Block Storage</h3>
          <p>Block storage is a more advanced way of storing data. In block storage, data is divided into fixed-size blocks and each block is assigned a unique identifier. It provides better performance and scalability compared to file storage, but it requires more management and configuration.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Object Storage</h3>
          <p>Object storage is a modern way of storing data. In object storage, data is stored as objects with metadata and a unique identifier. It provides high scalability, durability, and cost-effectiveness. It is ideal for storing unstructured data such as images, videos, and documents.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Object Storage Current State</h2>
          <p>Object storage is widely used in cloud computing and big data applications. Some of the popular object storage systems are Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage.
        </section>

          <h2>Object Storage Current State</h2>
          <p>if we have Object Storage System how to it is access in SAN (Secure Area Network)?</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Object Storage Current State</h2>
          <p>Access is possible through any Network protocols like UDP, HTTP2.0, HTTP1.1, HTTPS (TLS/SSL) and UDP</p>

        <!-- Proposed Solution Section and Intro to QUIC Protocol -->
        <section>
          <h2>Oppurtunity</h2>
          <p>The proposed idea is to develop a QUIC based object storage system that can provide high performance, scalability, and security.</p>
          <p>QUIC is a modern transport protocol that is designed to improve the performance of web applications. It provides low latency, multiplexing, and improved security features.</p>

          <h2>QUIC Introduction</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>QUIC = Quick UDP Internet Connections</li>
            <li>Next-generation transport protocol developed by Google</li>
            <li>Foundation for HTTP/3 (the latest web protocol)</li>
            <li>Deployed across Google services (Chrome, YouTube, Gmail)</li>
          </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>What QUIC Solves from HTTP2.0</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Head-of-Line Blocking: One lost packet stops ALL data streams</li>
            <li>TCP Handshake Overhead: Multiple round trips to establish connection</li>
            <li>Slow Connection Setup: 3 RTT for secure HTTPS connections</li>

        <section>
          <h2>Methodology</h2>
          <p>we will compare aspects both in single node system, how the performance is in while scaling Object Storage, by enabling security and disabling it.</p>
